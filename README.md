# Karabao

A Unity-based driving simulation tool

## Motivation

To train autonomous vehicles across a variety of environments and objectives

Karabao aims to be written as modularly as possible. This allows designers to quickly create new, challenging experiences for autonomous vehicle models to train against.

Karabao is meant to be a loosely-coupled companion to the donkey car framework.
